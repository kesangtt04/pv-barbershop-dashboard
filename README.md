> Free React Admin Dashboard made with Material-UI components and React + Vite.js.

# PVBarberShopDashboard

PVBarberShopDashboard is a customized admin dashboard built upon the **Minimal UI (Free Version)** template. While we retained some of the original UI components, we have completely re-implemented all functional features for different user roles, including **barbers**, **receptionists**, and **admins**.

> 📊 The only part we reused entirely is the **statistics/dashboard UI**, but we have integrated it with our real-time backend data.
